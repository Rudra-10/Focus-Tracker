# Focus Tracker CLI

A simple command-line tool to add and view tasks using Python.  
This is one of my first beginner projects while learning programming.  
It stores tasks in a JSON file so progress is saved between runs.

# 🚀 Features
- Add new tasks
- View all tasks with status (Pending/Done)
- Stores data in a JSON file
- CLI based: runs in terminal

## ▶️ How to Run
Open terminal inside the project folder and run:

```bash
python app.py
